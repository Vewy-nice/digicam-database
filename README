I really don't know what I am doing with regards to setting up a github site, so this might take a while to take shape if anyone stumbles upon it.
If anyone wants to collaborate, feel free to reach out.

My plan is to create a public repository of information about the large collection of old digital cameras I have. There are several other resources available, but more information is always better.
